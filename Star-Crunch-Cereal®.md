Star Crunch Cereal is made with real FPGA clusters! 

SCC is currently based around the Raspberry Pi 3B+ and a Lattice ECP5-5G evaluation board. The FPGA development leverages an open source workflow to generate the bitstream from Verilog based on [https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys Yosys] for synthesis, [https://github.com/SymbiFlow/prjtrellis Project Trellis] for FPGA database info, and [https://github.com/YosysHQ/nextpnr Nextpnr] for placing and routing. The Raspberry Pi serves as a high-level Linux interface and performs any networking to the outside world that needs to happen with the cluster. Even though the P&R would be slow, eventually the goal is to allow the Pi to generate a bitstream and reprogram the FPGA on the fly and allow the FPGA to reprogram parts of the Pi, creating an embedded metaprogramming environment. The current blocker is getting Nextpnr to compile on a RAM-limited system like the Pi.
